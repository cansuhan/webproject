            I appreciate the simple experience of everyday life, fleeting beauty of in-between moments, and for me
            photography has been a way of giving these back to the world. I initially started shooting digital
            photography but found myself wanting to experience the photographs more closely. When I was training as a
            field archaeologist in Cyprus, roaming around old town Nicosia, I found a basket of old film cameras in a
            second-hand bookshop. I was there looking at the cameras for a while and the owner came up to me, picked up
            a camera, and said back in the day this was his favourite to shoot with. We ended up talking for a while
            about photography and the beauty of simple moments that are often missed in the everyday bustle. Somehow, I
            was convinced I needed the camera he was selling, and thatâ€™s how I got into film photography. Shooting with
            film slows me down and makes me think more when collecting moments and developing the 35mm photographs
            myself has been an immersive experience.
